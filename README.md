# Basic-Js-Calculator
This code creates a simple calculator with buttons for numbers and basic mathematical operations. The calculator's display is a text input field that is disabled, so the user can only interact with the calculator through the buttons. The onclick event is used to append the value of the button to the display field when it is clicked, and the eval function is used to perform the calculation when the "=" button is clicked.

Note that this is a very basic calculator and does not handle any edge cases or errors, you could improve it by adding some error handling and making it more user friendly.
